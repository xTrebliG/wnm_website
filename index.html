                        <li>Buy products in bulk. Larger, economy-size products or ones in concentrated form use less packaging and usually cost less per ounce.</li>
                        <li>Avoid over-packaged goods, especially ones packed with several materials such as foil, paper, and plastic. They are difficult to recycle, plus you pay more for the package.</li>
                        <li>Avoid disposable goods, such as paper plates, cups, napkins, razors, and lighters.</li>
                        <li>Throwaways contribute to the problem, and cost more because they must be replaced again and again.</li>
                        <li>Buy durable goods - ones that are well built or that carry good warranties. They will last longer, save money in the long run and save and fill space.</li>

                Green Social Enterprises and consumers to achieve three goals regarding municipal waste: to educate, 
                empower and equip New Yorkers with the skills and resources to improve their sustainable waste management practices, 
                to promote the expansion of sustainable waste practices and to achieve meaningful results in decreasing the amount of 
                garbage produced and to increase diversion rates.
